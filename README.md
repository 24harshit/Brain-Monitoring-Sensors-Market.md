# Brain-Monitoring-Sensors-Market.md
Brain Monitoring Sensors are specialized medical devices designed to measure and analyze brain activity through various physiological signals. These sensors are used in diagnosing, monitoring, and managing neurological conditions such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and sleep disorders. They work by capturing electrical, biochemical, and hemodynamic activities, offering real-time insights into brain function. The market encompasses a wide range of sensor types, including electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), intracranial pressure (ICP) sensors, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensors.
